# Introduction
A TDD-based implementation of the FizzBuzz Kata in Python, Java, and C++.

This project demonstrates how to use **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to implement a simple algorithm across multiple programming languages. Each language folder includes both the solution and the unit tests that drive its development.

## Description of the problem
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`. Also a number is `Fizz` if it has a 3 in it and a number is `Buzz` if it has a 5 in it. 

## Example Output
```
1
2  
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
Fizz
14
FizzBuzz
...
```
